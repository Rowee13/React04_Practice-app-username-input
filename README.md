React Practice app #04

A simple username and age input app.

Topic discussed:
- Props
- CSS Styling using CSS modules
- React Hooks { useState, useRef }
- Custom Wrapper component (alternative to div as a wrapper)
- React Fragment
- React Portal for Modal component

I am creating public repositories for all the practice app I will be doing while taking a React course on udemy.
